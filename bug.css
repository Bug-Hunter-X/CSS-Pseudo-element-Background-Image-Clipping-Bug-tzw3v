The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when a pseudo-element (e.g., ::before or ::after) is used in combination with a background-image and a specified width or height. The background-image may not render correctly or may be clipped unexpectedly. This often happens when the content of the pseudo-element is empty or very small, and the width or height is defined using percentages or relative units.
